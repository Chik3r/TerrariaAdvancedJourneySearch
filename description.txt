This mod modifies the search function of the duplication menu (in Journey Mode) to allow you to search for items by mod (by placing a '@' before the mod name), or by item id ("id:nnnn" where n is the id number).
It also lets you search multiple things at once by separating them with the pipe character ('|').
Example: "@magicstorage | chair" to search for items from Magic Storage and chairs.
